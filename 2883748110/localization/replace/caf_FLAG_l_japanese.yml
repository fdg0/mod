 fascist_flag_enabled.tt:0 "Swap the current state flag with a another variant and back.  Note the game does not have variants for all of the flags.  Reset them them back to enable if you are going to swap player or go through unification.  Turn one back off before trying another as in some case they get locked when the base game flags are missing.  This is a rudimentary tool, but it does the job."
